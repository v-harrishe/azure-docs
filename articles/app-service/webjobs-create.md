# Run background tasks with WebJobs in Azure App Service

This article shows how to deploy WebJobs by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.cn) to upload an executable or script. For information about how to develop and deploy WebJobs by using Visual Studio, see [Deploy WebJobs using Visual Studio](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md).

## Overview
WebJobs is a feature of [Azure App Service](index.yml) that enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app, API app, or mobile app. There is no additional cost to use WebJobs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WebJobs is not yet supported for App Service on Linux.

The Azure WebJobs SDK can be used with WebJobs to simplify many programming tasks. For more information, see [What is the WebJobs SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/wiki).

Azure Functions provides another way to run programs and scripts. For a comparison between WebJobs and Functions, see [Choose between Flow, Logic Apps, Functions, and WebJobs](../azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs.md).

## WebJob types

The following table describes the differences between *continuous* and *triggered* WebJobs.


|Continuous  |Triggered  |
|---------|---------|
| Starts immediately when the WebJob is created. To keep the job from ending, the program or script typically does its work inside an endless loop. If the job does end, you can restart it. | Starts only when triggered manually or on a schedule. |
| Runs on all instances that the web app runs on. You can optionally restrict the WebJob to a single instance. |Runs on a single instance that Azure selects for load balancing.|
| Supports remote debugging. | Doesn't support remote debugging.|

## Supported file types for scripts or programs

The following file types are supported:

* .cmd, .bat, .exe (using Windows cmd)
* .ps1 (using PowerShell)
* .sh (using Bash)
* .php (using PHP)
* .py (using Python)
* .js (using Node.js)
* .jar (using Java)

## Create a continuous WebJob

<!-- 
Several steps in the three "Create..." sections are identical; 
when making changes in one don't forget the other two.
-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have source control configured with your application, the Webjobs should be deployed as part of the source control integration. Once source control is configured with your application a WebJob cannot be add from the Azure Portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.cn), go to the **App Service** page of your App Service web app, API app, or mobile app.

2. Select **WebJobs**.

2. In the **WebJobs** page, select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/web-sites-create-web-jobs/wjblade.png" alt-text="WebJob page":::

3. Use the **Add WebJob** settings as specified in the table.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-sites-create-web-jobs/addwjcontinuous.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add WebJob settings that you need to configure.":::

   | Setting      | Sample value   | Description  |
   | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
   | **Name** | myContinuousWebJob | A name that is unique within an App Service app. Must start with a letter or a number and cannot contain special characters other than "-" and "_". |
   | **File Upload** | ConsoleApp.zip | A *.zip* file that contains your executable or script file as well as any supporting files needed to run the program or script. The supported executable or script file types are listed in the [Supported file types](#acceptablefiles) section. |
   | **Type** | Continuous | The [WebJob types](#webjob-types) are described earlier in this article. |
   | **Scale** | Multi instance | Available only for Continuous WebJobs. Determines whether the program or script runs on all instances or just one instance. The option to run on multiple instances doesn't apply to the Free or Shared [pricing tiers](https://www.azure.cn/pricing/details/app-service/). | 

4. Click **OK**.

   The new WebJob appears on the **WebJobs** page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-sites-create-web-jobs/listallwebjobs.png" alt-text="List of WebJobs":::

2. To stop or restart a continuous WebJob, right-click the WebJob in the list and click **Stop** or **Start**.

    "schedule": "0 */15 * * * *"
}
```
